/**

1. Null Pointers:- A NULL pointer is a pointer that is pointing to nothing.
                   If we donâ€™t have the address to be assigned to a pointer, we can use NULL.

Advantages of Null pointer are:-
1. We can initialize a pointer variable when that pointer variable is not assigned any actual memory address.
2. We can pass a null pointer to a function argument when we are unwilling to pass any actual memory address.
