/**

A pointer behaves like a wild pointer when declared but not initialized.
So, they point to any random memory location.

Note ðŸ”¥: If a pointer p points to a known variable, itâ€™s not a wild pointer.

    int * p; /* wild pointer */
    int a = 10;
    p = & a; /* p is not a wild pointer now*/
    * p = 12; /* This is fine. Value of a is changed */
